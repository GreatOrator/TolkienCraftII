As promised, may this textfile serve as a reminder to the shining beacon of Minecraftforum User "Blue001"
who took upon himself the arduous task of reorganizing the Ruin templates file structure, resulting in
faster loading times for all whom it may concern.

Credit also goes to MCF User "jsmith" for providing an additional set of Ruin templates for everyone.

Finally, much gratefullness and wows go to Saeldur of the Minecraftforge IRC channel, who used his regex
and python prowess for justice and converting the 1.6 template block IDs to the new 1.7 name based format.
