LOTR lang file update-helper

The purpose of this helper is to assist people in updating the mod's lang files after a mod update.

When the mod is loaded, it checks all lang files against en_US.lang, and outputs a copy of them here.
If a lang file is missing any keys (i.e. names of new blocks, items, mobs, etc. added in a mod update) then those keys are added to the lang file.
Unnecessary keys are also removed from the lang file - for example, if a feature is removed from the mod.
The lang files outputted here also have their contents organised in the same order as en_US.lang, to make comparisons easier.

I hope this system will be much easier than manually checking your lang file against en_US.lang, for every update, to find out what has been added.

DO NOT STORE ANYTHING in this folder - the folder, and its contents, are re-created every time the mod loads.
Anything else in the folder will be deleted.
If you want to update one of the lang files in this folder, copy and paste it somewhere safe!

And finally, if you have updated a lang file (or created a new one) and want to send it to us, the best way to do so is through the mod's Facebook page.
We credit everyone by name unless asked not to, so please let us know if you do not want your name mentioned in the credits file.

Please note: Lang files must be in UTF-8 format, otherwise errors will occur.
