#Define blocks to whitelist as fertile soil here: <mod>:<blockname>:<blockmeta>
#You can get these values from NEI
#Whitelisting a block as a fertile soil means you can plant crops on them
#Note that this only works for crops that can be planted on farmland, crops that require a specific soil (e.g. nether wart or cactus) will still need that particular soil
#For example: Forestry:soil:0 (this will add forestry humus to the whitelist)
